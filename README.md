Scrum App
=====

Scrum App is an attempt at creating a simple and intuitive interface for SCRUM style Project Management.

To aid development of the app and because I have a firm belief in that constraints have these benefits:

- Good for creating user-centric software
- Easier to consume
- Easier to create
- Easier to design
- Easier to plan

Design Restrictions
===

- Use only one column, Grids allowed
- Typographical Interface - Use as little decorative elements as possible
- Use colour and embellishments only when there is sufficient evidence for a real benefit to the user.
- Before adding features, consider every other option (even changing an existing feature)
